# Fix Database Error - Quick Guide

## The Problem
You're getting this error:
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: table whitefly_image has no column named user_id
```

This happens because the database table structure doesn't match the model definition.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Apply the migrations you just created

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py migrate
```

You should see output like:
```
Running migrations:
  Applying whitefly.0002_image_last_modified_image_upload_date_image_user_and_more... OK
```

### Step 2: Restart Django server

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server, then:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 3: Test the upload

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login
3. Try uploading an image

## What Changed?

### ✅ Sidebar Improvements:
- **Clean white background** - Highly visible and professional
- **Light theme** - Easy to read with dark text on white
- **Emerald green accents** - Active items highlighted in emerald
- **User profile card** - Shows avatar with online status indicator
- **Organized sections** - "Main Menu" and "Account" sections
- **System status footer** - Shows system online status
- **Smooth hover effects** - Professional interactions
- **Collapsible** - Toggle between full (256px) and compact (80px) view

### ✅ Database Fix:
- Added `user_id` column to track who uploaded each image
- Added `upload_date` and `last_modified` timestamps
- Created `Result` model for storing detection results
- Better error handling with detailed tracebacks

## If Migration Fails

If you get errors during migration, you may need to reset the database:

```bash
# Backup your data first!
# Then delete the database
del db.sqlite3

# Delete migration files (except __init__.py)
del whitefly\migrations\0*.py

# Recreate migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a new superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Testing Without Detection API

If you don't have the detection API running yet, use the test API:

```bash
# In a new terminal
python detection_api_test.py
```

This will start a mock API on port 5000 that returns random detections for testing.
